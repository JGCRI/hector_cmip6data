# hector_cmip6data
CMIP6 data relevant for Hector v3 calibration

# Scripts
The ./scripts directory contains both Python and R scripts for each variable. The Python scripts are used to access CMIP6 data using Pangeo. Outputs get saved as csv files, which are read into R for further processing and visualization. 

Order of operations: Run the "A_" Python script, and then the corresponding "B_" R script/s. If present, RMarkdown files will have the prefix "C_."

The ocean heat flux variables (hfls, hfss, rlds, rlus, rsds, rsus) all have individual Python files. 

# Directories
Each directory named for a variable contains raw csv output files for each variable. The files are generated by the Python scripts, leveraging Pangeo. The corresponding R scripts then use these csv files to perform data manipulations and calculations to yield final output files. These output files are also csv files, location in ./outputs

# Heatflux variables
First, run `A4.heatflux_preprocessing.py` to isolate the Pangeo file locations for six heat flux variables. Then, run `B4a.heatflux_preprocessing` to isolate the files that contain information on all six variables. Then, run the individual `.py` files to download CMIP6 data for each variable. Finally, run `B4b.processing_heatflux.R` to extract output data. 

# Inputs
All csv files that are required in R files can be found in `./inputs`
