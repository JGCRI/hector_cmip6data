# land-ocean-warming-ratio
Code to parameterize the land-ocean warming ration within the HECTOR simple climate model using CMIP6 data.
Prepared by Skylar Gering as part of their 2020 SULI work, the original repo can be found here, https://github.com/skygering/land-ocean-warming-ratio but copied here so that all of Hectorâ€™s CMIP6 related code is consolidated in a single place. 

Note this code was not written using hector_cmip6data as its root directory.
